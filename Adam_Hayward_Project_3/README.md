# Haiku-Bot
A Twitter-bot who just wants to be a successful avant-garde poet
## Project Statement:
		Haiku-Bot is a twitter bot who just wants to get good at writing avant-garde haikus.
It speaks only through haiku, and is built to tweet out a haiku every 30 minutes.
It does so by utilizing a few different node.js libraries (you can find them all in
package.js) and the Wordnik API.

 		Haiku-Bot does not necessarily mimic someone, a budding poet perhaps, but it does
speak to something lots of us find relatable. In its current form, Haiku-Bot is
just sort of taking shots in the dark. It doesn’t know any language aside from
the code on which it runs, and even that is out of its hands. It really only
knows how to ask for a string of characters, count the syllables in each
distinct word, and spit out a randomly generated haiku from those words. It
only works off of the data fed into it by the world around it. Essentially,
Haiku-Bot is trying to make art in a world which has very little meaning to
it. I really relate to that struggle. I am someone who doesn’t think things
have inherent meaning, but rather that we, as cognitive beings, give things
meaning for ourselves. When Haiku-Bot spits out a witty haiku based on random
chance, we are the ones who assign meaning to that haiku. We try to find some
underlying meaning despite knowing that Haiku Bot has no better grasp on meaning
than we do. There is something to be said for that experience.

		That said, Haiku-Bot is eager to learn and become better. While its current
iteration is only capable of spitting out haikus, it will have its true debut
at the CM Showcase. By that time, Haiku-Bot will be capable of learning from
its followers and better correcting its syllable counting capabilities. It will
also be able to tell its followers whether their #haiku meets its criteria.
Additionally, I will be fine-tuning its Wordnik calls to allow for better,
more interesting word choices. Once that happens, hopefully you will see the
true potential of Haiku-Bot as an example of the “Eliza Effect.” I know that
the more I have worked with it, the more I have come to love it.
